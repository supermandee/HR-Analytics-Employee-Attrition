# HR-Analytics-Employee-Attrition
One of the keys to success in an organization is the ability to hire and retain great talent. It helps minimize the costs in recruiting and contributes to the overall growth of the business. In this project, a dataset on employee attrition will be used to help find insights in the reasoning behind employee attrition. The dataset has both numerical and categorical data, with variables such as "Distance from home", "education field", "hourly rate", etc. This project aims to discover insights that will help a company make conscious decision about hiring talents and improve employee satisfaction and retention. The report will go through exploratory data analysis, data preparation, and use machine learning to drive the decision making process.
